; Annotated ESP8266 bootrom disassembly.
;
;	Tom Trebisky 1-7-2016 began studying Kongo's disassembly
;	Tom Trebisky 1-24-2016 migrated to my own disassembly
;	Tom Trebisky 2-28-2017 busy with this again.
;	7-5-2018 - pull request by quietboil
;	7-7-2018 - redid entire disassembly using espdis script.
;
;---------------------------------------------------
;
; This is the ESP8266 bootrom -- 64K in size.
;
; I began with the bin file and made multiple passes to get
; this into an initial form that I liked.  Then I began adding
; annotation in the form of comments (like this one).
;
; Then in 7-2018, I took a multipass script I wrote for the
;  ESP32 and ran it on this, redoing everything.
; This yields a much better result.  I wrote a script to migrate
;  my hand generated comments from my old disassembly, and
;  have been doing hand cleanup.
;
; TODO --
; 1 - Get a firm understanding of ESP8266 interrupts.
;
;---------------------------------------------------
; The espdis script is by no means perfect, and has skipped some
; sections entirely.  This is because it simply did not have enough
; starting points -- but these are labeled in the disassembly below
; as "unknown" and can be filled in by hand.
;
;   unknown	; (not disassembled)
;
; What I do is to track these down one by one, then go to the old
; disassembly and figure out what is going on in these regions.
; When I find an unreferenced subroutine, I get the address and
; feed it to "espdis" like this:
;
;   espdis 400017e0 >zzz
;
; Then I examine the file "zzz" and cut and paste as appropriate.
; We could gather up all of these missing entry points and put
; them into a syms file by hand and then redo the whole batch,
; but we aren't going down that road.
;
; I am labeling unreachable functions that I have added by hand
;  "xsub_xxxx" in the following listing, so 400017e0 becomes
;  "xsub_17e0"
;
;---------------------------------------------------
; In early 2018 I got a pull request from "quietboil" that added
; annotation for flash erase commands.
; See: esp_spi_erase_sector -and- esp_spi_erase_block
; as well as other code.
;---------------------------------------------------
;
; The following is historic now that I am using the espdis script ....
;
; I did a couple of special things to generate the initial disassembly.
; - I converted the ".bin" file to a ".elf" file using a C program
;    that I wrote.  This let me add a symbol table derived from
;    the list of symbols in PROVIDE statements in eagle.rom.addr.v6.ld
;    This also let me set the proper text addresses for the
;    disassembly.  I keep the byte order correct (which is
;    reversed, i.e. little endian for 32 bit constants).
;
; - then I did the disassembly in sections based on those symbol
;    table addresses as starting points.  This greatly reduced but
;    did not eliminate the mis-aligned disassembly.
; - then I wrote some scripts to find all the l32r statements
;    and the 32 bit constants they reference and make the
;    display of these values civilized.
; - sometime late I understood the relocation of a large block
;    of data near the end of the ROM and rewrote the addresses
;    for that, which was a great help.
;
; I still find it necessary to "polish" the disassembly by
;  hand, finding improperly disassmbled sections of code and
;  so forth.
;
; I was first inspired by the work done by "Kongo"
;	http://dflund.se/~kongo/esp8266.bin/iram0.txt
; I began studying and annotating what he had done, then
;	migrated to my own disassembly.
;
; The ESP8266 bootrom is in some on-chip immutable ROM at
;    a base address of 0x40000000
;
; It is easy to dump the bootrom as binary using:
;	PORT            = /dev/ttyUSB1
;	esptool -p $(PORT) dump_mem 0x40000000 65536 bootrom.bin
;
; A naive disassembly can be done using:
;
;    xtensa-lx106-elf-objdump -D -b binary -mxtensa bootrom.bin >naive.dis
;
; The problem with this is that disassembly is not done properly at subroutine
; boundaries.  The disassembler looses track of alignment and does ugly thing.
; Kongo did something to remedy this, probably disassembling in sections using
;  start addresses for each subroutine.  A big improvement over the naive
;  disassembly and very much something to start work from.
;
; I compared the binary I pulled from my chips with the one Kongo began
;  with and found them identical.  As far as I know there is only one version
;  of the bootrom in the wild.
;
; ---------------------------------------------------------------
;
; The processor inside the ESP8266 is an Xtensa LX106
; This is a 32 bit RISC processor with 16 registers.
; Register use as I understand them so far is:
;
;	a0 - used for subroutine return address
;	a1 - stack pointer
;	a2 - first subroutine argument and return value if there is any
;
; There is a 662 page "instruction set architecture" manual available,
;  which is almost indispensible for sorting this stuff out.
;

; Here is a first cut at the address map which shows
; the locations of big items.
;
; 0x0000 0000 to 0x1fff ffff - empty, causes fault when reading
; 0x3ff0 0000 to 0x3ff0 0fff - "dport0" IO registers, see below
; 0x3ffe 8000 to 0x3ffb ffff - user data ram (80k)
; 0x3fff c000 to 0x3fff ffff - ETS system data ram (16k)
; 0x4000 0000 to 0x4000 ffff - bootrom, read only, cannot be changed (64k)
; 0x4010 0000 to 0x4010 7fff - iRam, used by bootloader to load SPI flash (32k)
; 0x4010 8000 to 0x4010 bfff - iRam, cache, used by OTA bootloader (16k)
; 0x4010 c000 to 0x4010 ffff - iRam, cache (16k)
; 0x4020 0000 to 0x401f ffff - SPI flash
;
; The claim is that up to 1M of flash can be "mapped", typically to 0x4010 0000
; but reputedly at any 1M boundary.
; There are two 16k RAM objects than can be used either as cache or as iRam.
; My understanding of this is that if you designate them to be used as cache
; then you don't get to use them as iRAM at a specific address, but they get
; used dynamically for the 1M of mapped flash.
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Notes on the dport0 registers
; These are accessed (as is often done), by a base address 0x200 behind
; their actual location, namely 0x3feffe00
; 0x3feffe00			- base for three IO registers in an odd spot - call it "Poochie"
;	+204 = 0x3ff0 0004 = INTC_EDGE_EN
;	       0x3ff0 0014 = CPU_SPEED  (not used in this boot code)
;	+20c = 0x3ff0 000C = SPI_READY
;	+224 = 0x3ff0 0024 = SPI__bank (see comments where used).
;
; Three bits are understood in INTC_EDGE_EN
;	0x01 enables watchdog interrupts
;	0x02 enables TIMER_FRC1 interrupts (not used in this ROM)
;	0x04 enables TIMER_FRCC interrupts
;
; The CPU speed control is done by the low bit, i.e 0x0001
;  when it is clear, the cpu runs at 80 Mhz.
;  when it is set, the cpu runs at 160 Mhz.
;  The bootrom runs at 52 Mhz and we have no clue why, or how to jump to 80.
;
; MAC address and chip info can be found here as follows:
;  0x3FF00050	OTP_MAC0[1]	OTP Memory (Contains byte 6 of MAC address at 0x3FF00053)
;  0x3FF00054	OTP_MAC1[1]	OTP Memory (Contains bytes 4-5 of MAC address at 0x3FF00055, 0x3FF00054)
;  0x3FF00058	OTP_CHIPID[1]	OTP Memory (Apparently contains info about chip model/version)
;  0x3FF0005C	OTP_MAC3	OTP Memory (Contains vendor portion (bytes 1-3) of MAC address)
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; How do things get started?  The reset vector goes to 0x40000080.
;
; Early on, it sets the vector base to 0x40000000 (right here!!)
; Which means there is no way for software to mess with the basic vector table.
; Note that the vector table simply has code every 16 bytes (0x10)

;  Why drop back 0x200 bytes to 0x5ffffe00?
;  A mystery to me, but seems to be something this
;  compiler does with most base registers.
;
; offset 0x14 is the clock divider (baud = basic/clock / divider)
;	this is a 20 bit value in a 32 bit register.
; offset 0x20 is uart_conf0 register

; once we get here, a6 has the proper "base address"
; a5 is a mask to select bits to test.
; l8ui is an 8 bit load from memory -
;	in this case it fetches from 3fffde10 + 40
;       on my running system this contains 0x00
; apparently this poking around will determine which uart is being used.
; so the multiply above will yield zero and a6 will be 0x5ffffe00
; note that l32i and s32i multiply the offset by 4 (shift it by 2)
; also note that the raw offset is 0x87 which becomes 0x21c when shifted
;  (i.e. the disassembler nicely shows us the shifted result).
; adding this to 0x5ffffe00 gives 0x6000001c
; offset 0x1c is the uart status register
; offset 0x00 is the uart fifo (shared by read and write)
