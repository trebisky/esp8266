Various miner scripts extract information
from 3 files that seem useful into *.sy files.

Then I merge symbols by hand.
Note that these files are sorted into address order.

I put all the ram symbols into dataram.sy
I put all the rom symbols into rom.sy

The bottom line is that ALL the symbols are in eagle.
The Kongo files (python or disassembly) do not add anything new.

I thought perhaps that the 1.5.0 SDK might "made public" some symbols
that were not in the exported symbol list in prior releases, but
this is not so.

I hand added the symbol _rom_start
(now done via hints file)
