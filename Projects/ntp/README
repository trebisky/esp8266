This is just an idea at this point, but what I want is an NTP managed clock
mounted on my wall that always shows the correct time.

Why you cannot just buy such a thing is a puzzle to me.

I purchased a clock on AliExpress with the idea of hacking it and using its display:

Price was $10.  It is a nice unit with an inscrutable interface.

1. General setting
Long press "SET" button to set "12/24H"→“Time”→"Year"→"Date"→"℃" by "+" and "-" buttons .(tap"set" button to enter next setting)
2. Display mode setting
Long press “+" button to switch display mode:
1) Display Time Only
2) Time, Date, Temperature Cycle Display
Alarm settings:
1.Tap "-" button to open/close alarm
2.Long press "-" button to enter alarm setting
3.Start snooze: when the alarm clcok rings, tap any key to start snooze ,alarm indicator light flashes slowly
4.Turn off the alarm: when the alarm clock rings, long press any key to turn off alarm, enter the next alarm state

Display the file "clock.webp"
